# DqcGenerator
Data warehouses often need to use DQC verification, but the verification rules are often relatively fixed and complex. Mass verification is a very tedious and error-prone job, so it is a meaningful job to generate DQC code based on fixed verification rules and visual operations. This project developed a visualization page based on Vue and some common verification rules, but the verification rules are constantly being optimized, so only the code for the visualization part is determined.
